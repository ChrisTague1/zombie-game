Debugging with curses

If you've tried to use the debugger or valgrind since adding curses to your game, you'll probably have found that they don't play nicely together.  This is because gdb and valgrind both use stdio, which depend on a different terminal configuration than we've set up for our curses environment.  There are ways around this.

To use valgrind, add the switch "--log-file=filename", where filename is a file name of your choosing.  All valgrind output will be redirected to the file, which you can view after your game exits.

To use gdb, you'll need a second terminal.  In the first terminal, run your game normally.  In the second terminal, cd to your build directory (where you run your game).  Then we need to get the running game's process identifier (PID).  "ps -few" lists all of the running processes on the system.  We'll "pipe" the output of ps to grep and search for processes whose command line included your game name.  Assuming your game is called "poke327":

ps -few|grep poke327

Output will be in several columns.  The second column gives the PID.  There may be multiple lines in this comment.  grep will likely catch itself (since poke327 was part of the command line), and perhaps the command that launched your editor will be there as well.  Use your eyes to scan through them and locate the one that corresponds with the running game, get that PID, and then you'll attach gdb to the running process:

gdb poke327 pid

where poke327 is the name of your game and pid is the PID that you found above.

gdb will stop the running process wherever it may have been.  You can continue with 'c', but first you probably want to set a breakpoint or two (with 'break').  You can force execution to stop at any point by hitting ^C in the gdb terminal.  When execution is not stopped, you can interact with your game in the game terminal.

PS:

There seems to be a configuration issue in the class VM which disallows gdb from attaching to running processes in user mode.  The most expedient solution to this is to run gdb as root using sudo.  The gdb command above becomes:

sudo gdb poke327 pid
